# GraphQL-React

This repository contains a simple implementation of a GraphQL server using Node.js and a React client that communicates with the server to display data in the browser.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6 or later)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)


## Usage

After completing the installation steps, the server and client should be up and running.

You can now open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the client application.

The client application displays a list of books retrieved from the server via a GraphQL query.

You can use the search bar to filter the list of books by title, author, or genre.
